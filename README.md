### How to Play

You are a mage tasked with cleansing the Blighted Forest from the evil that corrupts it.

You must complete a ritual every year, for ten years, by gathering magic from growing and harvesting various magical plants.

However, you must protect yourself from the Blight's attacks. Harvest plants on the purple tiles of your farm will instead protect you from the Blight, while harvesting plants on the yellow tiles on your farm will progress the Ritual to end the year.

Between years, use the Shop and Events to acquire more cards and make your deck stronger. Complete the final ritual on year 11 (or 10 on easy difficulty) to win the game!
